## Abstract
<!-- description -->
This is a report on the research result of Project Research A. In this term, I was able to experience what it was like to do research in a laboratory for the first time under [Dr. Edgar Simo-Serra](https://esslab.jp/~ess/en/).

## Results

In this semester, my goal was to conduct reinforcement learning to the game "東方花映塚 ～Phantasmagoria of Flower View", and I created a Gym environment in which agents uses to interact with this game.

I also conducted reinforcement learning using basic methods in this environment and summarized the results.
