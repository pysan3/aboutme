## Abstract
<!-- description -->
This is a report on the research result of Project Research A. In this term, I was able to continue my research in the spring semester under [Dr. Edgar Simo-Serra](https://esslab.jp/~ess/en/).

## Results

In this semester, I used the Gym environment of "東方花映塚 ～Phantasmagoria of Flower View" which I created in the spring semester, and performed reinforcement learning to increase the reward. Here, I propose a new method of reinforcement learning for the gym environment based on the results of this semester's research.
